Andre's libCellML Python Utils Properties
=========================================

Here we define the properties that are used in annotations by these utilities.
Ideally these will be replaced with more standardised identifiers at some point.

delayed-variable
----------------

:code:`https://github.com/nickerso/libcellml-python-utils/properties.rst#delayed-variable`

Used to indicate a variable in a model that should be delayed.
For example:

.. code::

    <sine_approximations-updated-ids.xml#b4da84> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/type> <ttps://github.com/nickerso/libcellml-python-utils/properties.rst#delayed-variable>
